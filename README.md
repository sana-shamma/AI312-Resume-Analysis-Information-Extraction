Information Extraction: Resume Analysis ðŸ“‘ðŸ’¼
===
Abstract: This project highlights the development and evaluation of a resume analysis system, particularly in information extraction. The resume analysis system utilizes one of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, which is Named Entity Recognition (NER), to automatically extract and categorize information from resumes, such as personal information, educational background, work experience, and skills. The aim is to facilitate human resources processes by automatically analyzing different sections of resumes.
